In this repo I will be implementing Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using just the numpy library. I am using the Breast cancer screening dataset for testing my code. 

1. Starting with the logistic regression with Gradient Descent. Used the log likelihood as the error function. The accuracy on the testset was ~94%. Just using accuracy as the eveluation metric and not the confusion matrix as the evaluation metric for now.
2. Coded a one hidden layer NN with 4 units on the same dataset and the accuracy on testset was >95%
